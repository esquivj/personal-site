  <article class="about-content">
    <p>I'm Juan. From Los Angeles originally, child of Mexican immigrants, raised by the internet, now living in Lisbon.</p>

    <p>I've been doing marketing in crypto for about four years now. Got in through content. Writing was the way in and honestly it's still the thing I keep circling back to. Lately I've been more drawn to brand and product marketing but storytelling kind of runs through all of it.</p>

    <p>Studied finance in school. Graduated around DeFi summer which was good timing I guess. The traditional finance path never really appealed to me. My parents got burned by 2008 and the opportunities I was seeing just felt off. Meanwhile crypto Twitter was going crazy. I knew I wanted in somehow.</p>

    <p>Moved to Lisbon after visiting a few years ago and not being able to get it out of my head. I was at a weird point in life and wanted to try something different. Timezone works for the job, beaches are nice, weather is similar to LA. Still figuring out if it was the right call but it feels like it. Looking to connect if you're in the area, DM me!</p>

    <p>When I'm not working I'm usually watching movies, digging through music, or hunting for good coffee shops around the city. In another life I helped run an indie electronic label with some friends in London. Tried my hand at DJing. I watch too much baseball, too many streamers, and I've seen every episode of Seinfeld more times than I'd admit. Have traveled to over 13 countries and counting.</p>

    <p>The stuff I actually care about: storytelling, creativity, world-building, brand. The part of work that doesn't feel like work.</p>
