      <p>Last week I was scrolling X when I stumbled on this post:</p>

        <img src="/images/building-way-in-tweet.jpg" alt="Tweet from van Schneider: In order to write about life, first you must live it. — Ernest Hemingway" width="600" height="300" />
      </figure>

      <p>I took this as a sign that it's time I published my journey into crypto and experience building startups. So here it is. A story about being on the outside, and building a way in.</p>

      <h2>The Pre-Crypto Era</h2>

      <p>Back in 2020-21 off the highs of DeFi Summer and lows of Covid shutdowns, I landed face first in the crypto industry. If you were around Crypto Twitter (CT) back then you know the wave of euphoria and optimism that was going on. Promises of decentralization, permissionlessness, and transparent technology. New rails for a new world.</p>

      <p>While this was happening online, offline in my personal life I was really struggling. I had recently graduated university and was not particularly excited about my options in tradfi. I studied Finance in university and was looking at financial services paths like wealth management and retail brokerages. I didn't have connections in tech. No one in my circle was in crypto. I was starting from zero, trying to break into an industry that didn't know I existed. Crypto, the alternative to tradfi, appealed and called to me.</p>

      <p>Over the summer of 2021, I looked for opportunities, interacted with people I admired, posted on CT to build an audience, and more importantly built proof of work.</p>

      <p>The method was simple: create and post content to open doors.</p>

      <p>When you don't have a network, you build one. When no one knows who you are, you make them notice.</p>

      <p>It works, it always does.</p>

      <h2>The Community Contributor Era</h2>

      <p>Posting content led me to Zach Davidson. At the time, Zach was running Growth and Community for RabbitHole, a quest and bounty platform that rewarded users for using crypto protocols or apps. Zach took notice of me and invited me to join the company's upcoming Metagovernance experiment. Here's where things shifted.</p>

      <p>Quick aside on self-doubt and fear. If you're reading this and struggle with these thoughts, do what I did. Before you overthink it, hit send. I promise you, you'll be surprised with how many conversations or doors open to those who simply knock. I really struggled with this early on, but my deep hunger to learn paired with humility helped me overcome this.</p>

      <p>During RabbitHole's Metagovernance initiative I focused on, you guessed it, creating more educational content and resources. We had a few goals: long-term it was figuring out how to effectively decentralize the RabbitHole protocol, and short-term, act as responsible governing tokenholders for protocols like Compound, Aave, Uniswap, and others.</p>

      <p>Meeting and speaking with people in this space is the most valuable thing you can do for yourself. I was on the outside looking in. I didn't know where to start. I thought to myself, "why would these individuals ever care to talk to me?"</p>

      <p><strong>Don't let this hold you back. Create value, give recognition, and most importantly become someone worth betting on.</strong></p>

      <figure class="post-image">
        <img src="/images/building-way-in-dm.jpg" alt="DM conversation with Zach from RabbitHole" width="600" height="400" />
      </figure>

      <p>(Quick aside: Zach and I actually met in person for lunch in LA a few months later. Hope you're doing well Zach, thanks for nudging me all those years ago.)</p>

      <p>After RabbitHole ended, I briefly contributed at Orca (later rebranded to Metropolis and is now known as Metal). Orca was building governance infrastructure for DAOs on top of multi-sig tech. Here, I contributed in working groups exploring how this technology itself could be decentralized as it became the foundation for many of the DAOs sprouting up at the time.</p>

      <p>Both of these experiences gave me something valuable: a community and network. As I'm sure you've noticed, a lot of this work was really just community contribution. Sometimes paid, sometimes not. Now, I realized I was ready to join a team full-time.</p>

      <h2>The Startup Era</h2>

      <p>I joined Boardroom as Content Lead in the summer of 2022. I posted a tweet broadcasting I was looking for my next project. I put myself out there and made it happen. A handful of teams showed interest and reached out. I jumped on a call with Kevin Nielsen, founder of Boardroom, the DAO governance tooling platform. Kevin offered me the chance to take over content and join the startup full-time. I agreed.</p>

      <p>At Boardroom I got my first real exposure to an early-stage technology startup. I quickly fell in love with the chaos and growth opportunities. I built the foundations of a content system and strategy, learned how technical teams operate, what building product takes, and most importantly learned everything I could about what it takes to build a company. This time I was on the inside.</p>

      <p>While at Boardroom I had the chance to form more connections and meet people like Bobby Bola, Governance Analyst at StableLab at the time. Bobby and I became good friends and stayed in touch over the following months. Over the holiday break of 2022, Bobby pushed me to apply at StableLab as they were in desperate need of crypto-native marketing help. I made a choice and followed my gut and applied.</p>

      <p>I got the role at StableLab, an early stage company operating as a governance services firm for many of the big DAOs/protocols in the space. It was at StableLab that the majority of my learnings happened. Over three years I did things I had never done before: brand development, product marketing, explored new forms of content, learned management skills, and so much more. I took the function from effectively zero, adapting as the company evolved toward a product-first model.</p>

      <p>Under the leadership of my founders Gustav Arentoft and Doo Wan Nam, I learned so much more than just marketing. I learned how to become a reliable, autonomous, adaptable operator within a startup. There are skills you can learn, but there are qualities that are hard to teach. Working in this environment produced and showed me that I really was built for this startup environment. Three years earlier I was a university grad with no network and no clear path to where I wanted to be. Now I was leading marketing at a company working with the biggest protocols in crypto. I built that.</p>

      <p>In January 2026 after 5 years of operations, StableLab unfortunately decided to shutdown. This chapter of my life is over but my story continues. And with it I take every single conversation, mistake, lesson, and connection I've made up until now.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned as an Outsider Who Made It In</h2>

      <p>The thing about startups is that you can read all day about them and what it's like but there is something only experience can teach. You will make mistakes. You will swim in chaos. But if you're willing to do the work, the work will open doors.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your background doesn't determine your ceiling</li>
        <li>Create opportunities when none exist</li>
        <li>Learn from your mistakes quickly, you will make them</li>
        <li>Become someone worth betting on</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Future and What's Next</h2>

      <p>Over the last 4-5 years since I entered the space so much has evolved. The industry and its companies are growing up. Institutions have arrived and will continue coming. Products and application layers are becoming useful with real users.</p>

      <p>I came into this space to build. That hasn't changed. I want to keep telling stories, keep learning, and find a team that cares about craft as much as I do.</p>

      <p>If you read this far, maybe you see yourself in my story. Maybe you're on the outside looking in right now. Maybe you don't have the network, the pedigree, the "right" background.</p>

      <p>Here's what I know: none of that has to matter. Build proof of work. Create value. Put yourself out there before you feel ready.</p>

      <p><strong>The path won't be handed to you. But you can build it yourself. I did.</strong></p>
